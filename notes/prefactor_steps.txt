- Preparation: flagging of the RFI, averaging of the data to manageable size,
flagging of problematic antennas and of periods in time when the calibrator
field is below 20 degress elevation (where the dipole response is highly suppressed).
Final averaging to bring data to 4s resolution and 4 channels per SB (195.3kHz) freq res.
For HBA 1 channel per SB.
Calibrator visibilities are predicted from a calibrator model.
Before any solve step, we perform a baseline-based Gaussian smoothing to exploit time
coherency of all systematic effects along the time axis.
- Polarization alignment: Estimate values of a diagonal plus a rotation Jones matrix.
First correct for polarisation misalignment introduced by the station calibration tables.
- Faraday rotation: Estimation of the Faraday rotation. Align the polarisation
data streams using the result of the polarization alignment. Use the theoretical
dipole-beam estimation to correct for its effect.
- Amplitude calibration: isolate the amplitude bandpass. 
- Clock and ionospheric calibration: calibration of clock and ionospheric delays.
Clock/TEC separation to find the best fit of these two parameters across the bandwidth for 
each time step.
